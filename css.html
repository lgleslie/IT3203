          and design of web pages.</p>
          
          <p class="p">It works in conjunction with HTML, which provides the structure or
          content of a website, while CSS defines how that content should be displayed to users. With CSS,
          developers can adjust colors, fonts, margins, borders, spacing, background images, and much more.</p>
          
          <p class="p">This seperation of structure and style not only makes websites easier to mannage but also improves 
          accessibility and design consistency across multiple pages. CSS plays a critical role in making 
          websites visually appealling and user-friendly, giving designers the flexibility to bring creative
          ideas to life while ensuring the site remains functional and readable on various devices and screen 
          sizes.</p>

        <p class="p"><b>There are three primary ways to implement CSS into a web project: Inline, Internal and External.</b></p>
        
        <p class="p">Inline CSS is written directly within an HTML tag using the style attribute. While it's helpful for 
        applying quick, one off changes, its not ideal for large-scale projects due to its lack of scalability 
        and difficulty in maintenance.</p>
        <p class="p">Here is an example of Inline CSS</p>
        <p class="round" class="p">&lt;p style="color&#58;purple;"&gt;This paragraph will be purple&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        
        <p class="p">Internal CSS, placed inside a style tag within the HTML document's head element,
        allows styling for that particular page. This method is useful for single-page sites but still become
        disorganized if overused.</p>
        <p class="p">Here is an example of Internal CSS</p>
        <p class="round" class="p">&lt;style&gt;<br>body &#123;<br> background-color&#58; green&#59; <br>&#125;</p>
        
        <p class="p">The most effective and commonly used approch is external CSS, where styles 
        are stored in a separate css file and linked to HTML documents using a link tag. This approach promotes 
        cleaner code, easier updates, and greater control over the entire websites's look and feel, especially
        when dealing with multiple pages that share the same design elements. Additionally the external stylesheet 
          should not include any HTML tags. </p>
        <p class="p">Here is an example of linking the External CSS into the HTML document</p>
        <p class="round" class="p">&lt;head&gt<br>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"&gt<br>&lt;/head&gt</p>
        <p class="p">Here is how the External CSS looks like<br> "mystyle.css"</p>
        <p class="round" class="p"> body &#123 <br> margin&#58; 0&#59;<br>background-color&#58; red&#59;<br>&#125;<br>
          <br>
          h1&#123 <br> color&#58; green&#59; <br> margin-right&#58; 20px&#59; <br>&#125;</p>
    
        <hr>
        <p class="p">Modern CSS also supports responsive web design, which is essential in today's mobile-first world. Responsive
        design ensures that web pages look and function properly on all  screen sizes, from smartphones to desktop
        monitors.</p>
        
        <p class="p">CSS features like media queries, flexiable grid layouts (such as CSS Grid and Flexbox), and relative 
        units like percentages or em allow developers to build interfaces that automatically adjust to different devices
        and resolutions. Additionally, CSS inclues animation and transition properties that enable interactive and engaging
        user experiences without the need for JavaScript.</p>
        
        <p class="p">As technology continures to evolve, CSS remains a vital skill
        for web developers and designers, providing the fondation for attractive, efficient, and adaptable websites.</p>
