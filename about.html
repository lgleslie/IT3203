    <p>HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It provided that 
      basic building blocks for webpages by using a system of tags and elements to define things like headings. paragraphs, images, links and more.
      These elements tell a web browser how to display content, making HTML essential for everythings you see online-from simple text pages to 
      complex interactive websites.</p>

    <p>HTML works by using opening and closing tags, typically enclosed in angle brackets. For example, the letter p in between two angle bracketsstarts 
      a paragraph and a / before the letter p ends the paragraph. These tags are used to wrap content and give it structure. While HTML by itself forces mainly 
      on content and structure, it often works together with CSS and JavaScript- forms the foundation of nearly all websites today.</p>

    <p>As web technology has evolved, so has html. The last version, HTML5, introduced many new features like support for video and audio playback, improved form 
      elements, and enhanced semantic tags. These improvements make HTML more powerful and accessible, helping developers create richer and more organized 
      websites without needing extra plugins or tools.</p>
