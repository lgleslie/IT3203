    <h2 class="h2">HTML</h2>
    <p class="p">HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It provided that 
      basic building blocks for webpages by using a system of tags and elements to define things like headings. paragraphs, images, links and more.</p>
      
    <p class="p">These elements tell a web browser how to display content, making HTML essential for everythings you see online-from simple text pages to 
      complex interactive websites. HTML is essential not only of vidual layout but also for search engine
      optimization (SEO). The internet we know today functions of HTML.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="p">HTML uses opening and closing tags, which usually are placed in angle brackets, to identify and structure content. A tag like &lt;p&gt; indicates
      the start of a paragraph, while &lt;/p&gt; signals the end of the paragraph. These tags act like contains that hold the content and give it meaning.
      Other common tags include &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; for headings, &lt;a&gt; for hyperlinks, &lt;img&gt; for images, and &lt;div&gt; for generic 
      containers that group other elements.</p> 
      <p class="p"> HTML documents follow a specific structure that includes a &lt;head&gt; section (which holds metadata, page 
      titles, and links to stylesheets or scripts) and a &lt;body&gt; section (which contains the content the user sees.) This format helps browsers 
      understand and properly display the page, ensuring that users get a consistent experience across different devices and platforms.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="p">The structure of the HTML document begins with the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt decloration. The purpouse of this is to define that this document is a 
      HTML5 document. Next is the &lt;html&gt element which is nessesary because it is the root element in the HTML document. Then is the &lt;head&gt element which
      hold the &lt;title&gt element and other elements previously listed. To close out the &lt;head&gt element use &lt;/head&gt. Following this is the &lt;body&gt 
      element and this elements holds all the headings paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, lists, tables and anything the is visible on the document. Similar to the 
      &lt;head&gt elemnt to close out the &lt;body&gt element use &lt;body&gt. After that you finish the entire docuemnt with &lt;/html&gt. Then you have completed your 
      first HTML document.</p>

    <p class="p">As web technology has evolved, so has HTML. The latest version of HTML is HTML5. HTML5 introduces a variety of new features to improve how web content
    is stuctured and how multimedia elements are handled.</p>
    <p class="p">It adds new semantic tags like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;, which make code more readable and easier to understand, 
      both for developers and search engines. HTML5 also supports embedding video and auto directly into web pages with the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags, eliminating 
      the need for third-party plugins.</p>
    <p class="p">These improvments make HTML more powerful and efficient, allowing developers to build modern, interactive websites with cleaner code and better performance. 
      Whether you're creating a simple webpage or a complex web application, HTML remains the essential starting point for bringing your content to life online.</p>
