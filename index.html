    <p class="p">In the evolution of technology the key components of the web are HTML/CSS, browser, Web server and URL.
      Among these fundamental elements of the web is HTML.</p>
    
    <p class="p">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the fundamental language to describe a webpage.
      Hypertext refers to text that is not linear and it contains links to other texts.
      Hyper media can also be a reference to hypertext and it includes graphics, video and sound.</p>
      
    <p class="p">HTML is the standard markup language to describe web pages and documents through the use of tags. Web browsers 
      render the given tags and show the content in a more legible format.
      HTML is important to the evolution of the web and one of the key elements that makes the Internet what it is today.</p>

      <p class="p"><img src="Creator Tim.jpg" alt="Creator Tim" style="float:right;width:250px;height:250px;">The original 
      verson and HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Tim Berners-Lee is a computer scientist born in England. He is
      the inventor of the World Wide Web (WWW), the URL system and HTTP.</p>
      
      <p class="p">In his numerous contributions to computer science he is known for implementing the first web browser/server 
      fostering the development of the World Wide Web as we know it. As time went on more and more different versions of the 
      original HTML have been created with updates to create more responsive  and modern HTML websites. </p>
    
      <p class="p">Tim Berners-Lee's intensions with creating HTML was for it to be a way to share and conncet document 
      over the internet. With the use of hyperlinks it allowed users to move from one page to another swiftly. The original version called 
      HTML 1.0 was a simple version compared to what we have now. It focuses on formatting text, linking pages and embedding basic images into the 
      documents. HTML 1.0 was the foundation for the growing development of HTML.</p>

    <p class="p">As time went on the versions of HTML began to increase with this came more flexabily and a wide
    range of abilities the Markup Language gave the users. Years later, versions 3.2 and 4.01 were deveopled 
    allowing users to design the layout of the document. The inclusion of more elements allowed users to be 
    more creative.</p>
    <p class="p">Stylesheets and scripting with JavaScript changed the game to how far you could design 
    the pages. Years later in efforts to modernize HTML the World Wide Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext 
    Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) collaborated to create HTML5 in 2014.</p>
    <p class="p">HTML5 came with significant improvements. It was now able to support video, audio, and 
      graphics which increased user engagment. New elements improved the stucture of the pages and the accesabily to the web.</p>
